### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Barbara, a computer engineering student at Technical faculty in Rijeka, Croatia.

Skills: C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Unreal Engine 4 + 5, Unity.

Students like me are a dime a dozen, but I do believe I present a valuable asset to any development team, for reasons such as:

1. Complete flexibility
2. Transparent communication
3. Ability to multitask
4. Wide range of knowledge and interests
5. Fast learning

...and, of course, a shoulder to cry on when the errors begin to bully you.

Easy-going, but pedant and precise. Capable of working in a team or by myself.

Currently available for projects. You can find me on LinkedIn or by email: barbara.rados22@gmail.com
