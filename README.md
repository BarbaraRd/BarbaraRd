### Welcome to my profile!

I'm Barbara, a computer engineering student at Technical faculty in Rijeka, Croatia.

Students like me are a dime a dozen, but I do believe I present a valuable asset to any development team, for reasons such as:

1. Complete flexibility
2. Transparent communication
3. Expertise in multiple fields
4. Ability to multitask
5. Wide range of knowledge and interests
6. Fast learning

...and, of course, a shoulder to cry on when the errors begin to bully you.

Easy-going, but pedant and precise, I bring a calm atmosphere to a stressful workspace in order to get the job done and motivate team members to focus.

Currently available for projects, DMs and email are open.
